# Custom DiscordBot

Custom DiscordBot made for our private, personal Discord server. This is just a fun project several teammates work on occasionally in our free time. This is currently only available to those on the server, however a deployable version for anyone to use is planned.

## Current commands

-   help
-   move
-   listroles
-   ping
-   role
-   randommove
-   sword

And many more planned!

## How to use

`>help` lists the commands and gives a tip on how to use other commands.

To understand how a certain command works use `>commandName help` to get meaningful information about the command.
