# Custom DiscordBot
Custom DiscordBot made for my private, personal Discord server. This is just a fun project a couple teammates and I work on occasionally in my free time. This is currently only available to those on the server, however a deployable version for anyone to use is planned.

Current commands
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* help
* move
* listroles
* ping
* role
* randommove
* sword

And many more planned!

How to use
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
`>help` lists the commands and gives a tip on how to use other commands.

To understand how a certain command works use `>commandName help` to get meaningful information about the command.
